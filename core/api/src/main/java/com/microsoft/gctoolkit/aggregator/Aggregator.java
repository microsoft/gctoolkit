/**
 * An Aggregator consumes a JVMEvent, extracts data from the event, and calls on an
 * Aggregation which collates the data.
 * An Aggregators uses the <code>{@literal @}Aggregates</code> annotation to declare the
 * EventSource(s) of the JVMEvents it handles.
 * The constructor of an Aggregator must call {@link #register(Class, Consumer)}
 * to register the consumer methods of JVMEvents the Aggregator consumes.
 * <p>
 * This example Aggregator aggregates events from the G1GC event source. It consumes
 * and processes four different events. The {@code Consumer} method for each event extracts
 * the cause of the collection and calls the GCCauseAggregation {@code record} method.
 *
